This report presents the analysis and simulation of a differential pair amplifier with a resistor at the source. The primary objective of this experiment is to examine the behavior of the amplifier 
by varying different parameters and evaluating its stability in terms of differential gain, common-mode gain, and overall frequency response.

# Introduction
A differential amplifier is a fundamental building block in analog circuit design, commonly used for signal amplification while rejecting common-mode noise. 
It amplifies the difference between two input signals, making it highly effective in applications such as sensor signal processing, communication circuits, and operational amplifier stages.

The basic structure of a differential amplifier consists of two transistors (MOSFETs or BJTs) sharing a common emitter/source connection. 
The resistor at the source terminal plays a crucial role in setting the bias current and improving linearity, but it introduces certain limitations. 
These include reduced gain, increased thermal sensitivity, and limited common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR).

To overcome these drawbacks, current sources can be used in place of the resistor. A current source provides a more stable biasing mechanism, improving gain stability, CMRR, and overall performance. 

# Procedure
## DC Analysis:

To maintain the proper operation of the differential amplifier, both MOSFETs were ensured to be in the saturation region by keeping all key parameters identical for both transistors. 
This step was crucial in ensuring symmetry and balanced operation, which is essential for stable differential amplification.

1. Initial Biasing:
The drain current (Id) and the saturation current (Iss) were initially set slightly lower than the theoretically calculated values 0.599mA and 1.199mA respectively.
This was done to account for practical considerations in chip manufacturing, where even nano-scale variations in current can significantly impact power dissipation.

3. Fine-tuning Rd for Vout:
Once the initial biasing was established, the drain resistor (Rd) was adjusted to achieve the desired output voltage (Vout).

3. Theoretical Calculations:
The exact values of Rd, the source resistance (Rss), and the MOSFET width (W) were slighty modified/made more precise to ensure the amplifier operates within the required constraints.

## Transient Analysis

1. Theoretical vs. Simulated Gain Verification:

The theoretical voltage gain of a single MOSFET stage was first calculated.
Since a differential pair amplifier provides twice the gain of a single MOSFET, this theoretical value was compared with the simulated differential gain to ensure accuracy.

2. Linearity and Distortion Analysis:
As the input signal approached the maximum and minimum swing limits, the output waveform began to show distortion and loss of linearity.
This behavior highlighted the limitations of the amplifier in handling large signals and emphasized the importance of maintaining operation within the linear range for accurate signal processing.

With this transient analysis, the amplifierâ€™s differential gain, common-mode swing behavior, and linearity constraints were effectively studied and verified.
